# p200_number_of_islands
[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn num_islands(grid: Vec<Vec<char>>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - DFS - iterative

- m = number of rows
- n = number of columns
- time complexity: $O(m X n)$
- space complexity: $O(min(m, n))$

## Second approach - DFS - recursive

- m = number of rows
- n = number of columns
- time complexity: $O(m X n)$
- space complexity: $O(min(m, n))$
