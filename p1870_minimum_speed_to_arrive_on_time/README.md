# p1870_minimum_speed_to_arrive_on_time
[https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-speed-to-arrive-on-time/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-speed-to-arrive-on-time/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn min_speed_on_time(dist: Vec<i32>, hour: f64) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```
  
## First approach - Binary Search Using BFS

- `n` = `dist.len()`
- `k` = maximum possible answer
  
- time complexity: $O(n \cdot \log k)$
- space complexity: $O(1)$
