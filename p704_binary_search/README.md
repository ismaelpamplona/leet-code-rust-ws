[https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn search(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```
## First approach - Binary Search

- n = number of nodes
- time complexity: $O(\log n)$
- space complexity: $O(1)$
