[https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn min_reorder(n: i32, connections: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - DFS - recursive

- n = number of nodes
- time complexity: $O(n)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$

## Second approach - DFS - iterative

- n = number of nodes
- time complexity: $O(n)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$
