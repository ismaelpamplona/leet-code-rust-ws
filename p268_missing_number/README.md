# p268_missing_number
[https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn missing_number(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type; and
2. the return type;

## First approach - Hashing

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)

## Second approach - Bit manipulation (xor)

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)

## Third approach - Addition Approach

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)
