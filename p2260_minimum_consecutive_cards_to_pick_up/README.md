## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn minimum_card_pickup(cards: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {

    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type; and
2. the return type;

## First approach - hashmap

- n = length of `cards`
- time complexity: $O(n)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$
