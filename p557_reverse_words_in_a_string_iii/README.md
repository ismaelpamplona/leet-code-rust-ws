# p557_reverse_words_in_a_string_iii
[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/)

## Initial provided code

```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn reverse_words(s: String) -> String {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type; and
2. the return type;


## First approach - two pointers

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)
