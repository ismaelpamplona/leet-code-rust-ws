[https://leetcode.com/problems/first-letter-to-appear-twice/](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-letter-to-appear-twice/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn repeated_character(s: String) -> char {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type; and
2. the return type;

## First approach - Hashing

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)
