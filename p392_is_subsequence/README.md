# p392_is_subsequence
[https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn is_subsequence(s: String, t: String) -> bool {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type; and
2. the return type;

## First approach - Two Pointers

- n = number of characters in the `s` string
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)
