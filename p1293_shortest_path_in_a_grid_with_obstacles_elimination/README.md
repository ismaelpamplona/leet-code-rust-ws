# p1293_shortest_path_in_a_grid_with_obstacles_elimination
[https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn shortest_path(grid: Vec<Vec<i32>>, k: i32) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- $m$: number of rows
- $n$: number of cols
- $k$: remain
- time complexity: $O(m ⋅ n ⋅ k)$
- space complexity: $O(m ⋅ n ⋅ k)$
