# p933_number_of_recent_calls
[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
struct RecentCounter {

}


/** 
 * `&self` means the method takes an immutable reference.
 * If you need a mutable reference, change it to `&mut self` instead.
 */
impl RecentCounter {

    fn new() -> Self {
        
    }
    
    fn ping(&self, t: i32) -> i32 {
        
    }
}

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * let obj = RecentCounter::new();
 * let ret_1: i32 = obj.ping(t);
 */
```
