# p1091_shortest_path_in_binary_matrix
[https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn shortest_path_binary_matrix(grid: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - 
- $n²$: number of nodes (matrix: `n x n`)
- time complexity: $O(n²)$
- space complexity: $O(n²)$, `seen` set can grow to n²
