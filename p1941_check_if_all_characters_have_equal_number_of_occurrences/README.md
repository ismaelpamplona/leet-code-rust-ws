# p1941_check_if_all_characters_have_equal_number_of_occurrences
[https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-characters-have-equal-number-of-occurrences/](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-characters-have-equal-number-of-occurrences/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn are_occurrences_equal(s: String) -> bool {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type;
2. the return type; and 
3. that LeetCode tests uses a vector of vectors as input.

## First approach - 

- time complexity: $O(n)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$
