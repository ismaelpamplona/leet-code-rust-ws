[https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn simplify_path(path: String) -> String {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - Split string and stack

- n = number of nodes
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)
