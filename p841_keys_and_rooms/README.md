[https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn can_visit_all_rooms(rooms: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> bool {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - DFS - recursive

- n = number of nodes
- e = number of edges
- time complexity: $O(n + e)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$

## Second approach - DFS - iterative

- n = number of nodes
- e = number of edges
- time complexity: $O(n + e)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$
