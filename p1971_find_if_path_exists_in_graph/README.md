# p1971_find_if_path_exists_in_graph
[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn valid_path(n: i32, edges: Vec<Vec<i32>>, source: i32, destination: i32) -> bool {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - DFS - iterative

- n = number of nodes
- e = number of edges
- time complexity: $O(n + e)$
- space complexity: $O(n + e)$

## First approach - DFS - recursive

- n = number of nodes
- e = number of edges
- time complexity: $O(n + e)$
- space complexity: $O(n + e)$
