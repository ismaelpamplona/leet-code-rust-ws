[https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-balloons/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-balloons/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn max_number_of_balloons(text: String) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type; and
2. the return type;

## First approach - Hashing

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)
