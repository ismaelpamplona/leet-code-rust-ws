# p2352_equal_row_and_column_pairs
[https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-row-and-column-pairs/](https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-row-and-column-pairs/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn equal_pairs(grid: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
   
    }
}
```

## First approach - Hashing

- n = grid has a size $n^2$
- time complexity: $O(n^2)$
- space complexity: $O(n^2)$
