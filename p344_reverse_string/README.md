# p344_reverse_string
[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn reverse_string(s: &mut Vec<char>) {
        
    }
}
```
So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type;
2. the return type; and 
3. that LeetCode tests uses a vector as input.

## First approach - Two Pointers

- n = number of chars
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)
