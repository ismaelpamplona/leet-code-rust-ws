# p2270_number_of_ways_to_split_array
[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-array/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-array/description/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn ways_to_split_array(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

So, at this point I know:
1. the parameter type;
2. the return type; and 
3. that LeetCode tests uses a vector of vectors as input.

## First approach

```Rust

```


- n = nums.len()
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)
