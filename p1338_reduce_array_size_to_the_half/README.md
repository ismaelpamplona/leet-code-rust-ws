# p1338_reduce_array_size_to_the_half
[https://leetcode.com/problems/reduce-array-size-to-the-half/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduce-array-size-to-the-half/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn min_set_size(arr: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - Greedy

`n`:the number of elements in vector `arr`
 
- time complexity: $O(n \cdot \log n)$
- space complexity: $O(n)$
