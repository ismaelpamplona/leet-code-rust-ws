# p323_number_of_connected_components_in_an_undirected_graph
[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)

## Initial provided code
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn count_components(n: i32, edges: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> i32 {
        
    }
}
```

## First approach - DFS - iterative

- n = number of nodes
- e = number of edges
- time complexity: $O(n + e)$
- space complexity: $O(n + e)$

## Second approach - DFS - recursive

- n = number of nodes
- e = number of edges
- time complexity: $O(n + e)$
- space complexity: $O(n + e)$
